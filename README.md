Instructions:
In order to add a new task to the list, simply type its name in the box at the bottom of the screen. When you are done naming it,
press the Floating Action Button (plus sign in the middle) to add the task. The date will automatically be added to the task. When the 
task status is changed to "complete", simply press the "done" button to remove it.

Lessons Learned:
This project was much harder than the previous two, for me. I don't have much experience with React, or even Javascript for that matter,
so the learning curve was steep. The entire field seems to be very fast moving. I spent alot of time with quite a few different tutorials,
and even ones that were written a mere 10 months ago were sometimes grossly out of date. This was actually quite illuminating, though,
if slow going. I did learn alot about project structure, components, stylesheets, code injection, and quite a few other things, though, 
just by piecing together the differences between out of date tutorials and the way the documentation instructs you how to do things today.
Again, highly inefficent, but instructive nonetheless. Once I am finally caught up and completed with this semester's work I intend
to revisit web application design in this manner. React seems very powerful once you get the hang of it and I look forward to diving 
deeper into it once I can.
